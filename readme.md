The idea with this repo is to have a simple tool to work with resumes. It will include the following:
- A resume parser that converts a resume from PDF to markdown
- A resume screener that analyzes the resume and provides a concise summary and key takeaways
- An interview simulator that analyzes the resume and generates contextual interview questions
- A resume builder that creates variants of a given resume to match specific job descriptions

Log:
- Tried using tesseract for OCR but it was quite bad so moving on to a LLM / Visual Model approach.
